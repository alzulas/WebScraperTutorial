# WebScraperTutorial
 This tutorial brought to you by "Web Scraping with Python"


Basically, I wanted to learn this stuff because I find that there isn't a good database of all the wineries in any one state. You can get the data by going to each associations page and typing the data by hand, but I'd rather make a web scraper and a web crawler that can find all the info about each winery, like Name, Location, Phone number, types of wines available, awards given, etc. I don't want to have to do it all by hand, so I'm going to make a python script to do it for me. Then I can maybe pair this data with some of the wine attributes data sets and create a really extensive database of wine. 

Happy hunting!





# DC Universe Episodes sorted by airdate. 

Using what I've learned from the book, I scraped out the DC Universe shows - Super Girl, Arrow, Legends of Tomorrow, and Flash, and copied the episode names and airdates. I then sorted them by airdate. Now, if anyone would like to watch them by airdate, there's a good list. :) Enjoy!
